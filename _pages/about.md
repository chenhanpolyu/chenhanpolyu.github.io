I'm a senior engineer working in **Riemann Lab, Huawei**. My research topics are about **robotics, including motion planning, path planning, environment perception and mapping, and system integration.** Currently, my greatest passion is focusing on transforming my knowledge and research into commercial products that make a difference and help others. Riemann Lab offers the best location and mapping services in the world and pushes the boundaries of technological innovation. Our cutting-edge research has been instrumental in the development and commercial success of smart technologies across various sectors, including smartphones, smart cars, smartwatches, cloud services, and communication equipment.

Before I joined Huawei, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering in January 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Chih-yung WEN](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/researchgrp/cywen/index.php/en/index.html) and [Prof. Peng Lu](https://arclab.hku.hk/PengLu.html). I studied and lived in Beijing for 7 years ahead of the journey to HK, and I got the B.Eng. and M.Sc.(supervisor: [Prof. Hongbin Deng](https://smen.bit.edu.cn/old/sztd/szms/znwrxtjsx/877c8ef1a70f462b9bd0487b5c319078.html) from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2016 and 2019 respectively. In 2021, I had a very valuable opportunity to visit the [FAST LAB](http://zju-fast.com/) at Zhejiang University. I spent an extraordinary six months there, receiving important guidance from [Professor Gao Fei](http://zju-fast.com/fei-gao/) and meeting many outstanding scholars and engineers in the field of robotics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by those experienced and talented scholars mentioned. Thanks to their critical guidance and enthusiastic assistance, I found and engaged in the research and working career that I am passionate about.
